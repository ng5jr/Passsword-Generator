# Passsword-Generator

Have you ever found yourself thinking about a sofisticated password to fulfill the different websites requirements? I have developed this random password generator that let the user specify the options like numbers, symbols, length, etc.

It can be used as website or as Google Chrome Extension.

In order to add it as an Extension it only takes a few steps listed below:

1-Fork the projects or download it to your local repository. /n
2-Open Google Chrome and go to Settings
3-Go to "More Tools" and then "Extentions"
4-On the upper right corner make sure you have "Developer Mode" selected
5-Go to the upper left corner and click on "Load unpacked"
6-Browse to your local repository location and just select the folder containing the files
7-Voal√°, you have the extension up and running

I hope this is useful, thanks for passing by!
